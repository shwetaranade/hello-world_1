What is GIT?
Git is a source code management (SCM) system.
Git allows a team of people to work together, all using the same files. And it helps the team cope with the confusion that tends to happen when multiple people are editing the same files.
downloads all the files from Github, which is an online server we're all connected to. So he has his local version of the files, I have my local version.
There is a main branch, and you can create your own branch.
